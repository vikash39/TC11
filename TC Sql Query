We would like to fetch the information of MFGPart from production. Please run the following query and share the result.

 

Select l.puid as UID, pitem_id as itemid, pobject_type as Objecttype FROM PITEM l -- ITEM ID
JOIN PTD4MFGPart mfg ON mfg.puid = l.puid;


Please see attached file for the results of the query:

 

Select l.puid as UID, pitem_id as itemid, g.pobject_type as Objecttype FROM PITEM l -- ITEM ID

JOIN PWORKSPACEOBJECT g ON g.puid = l.puid

JOIN PTD4MFGPART mfg ON mfg.puid = l.puid;


Sending sql results from this query:

Select l.puid as UID, pitem_id as itemid, g.pobject_type as Objecttype FROM PITEM l -- ITEM ID

JOIN PWORKSPACEOBJECT g ON g.puid = l.puid and g.pactive_seq <> '0'

JOIN PTD4MFGPART mfg ON mfg.puid = l.puid;
